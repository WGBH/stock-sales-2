Our rights ready digital clip collection was created from WGBH’s most well known 
series, NOVA, Frontline and American Experience.   This collection includes over 
10,000 short clips on a variety of topics including science, education, health, 
historical recreations, nature, animation and more.   (Note that the clips do not 
include content from our most recent programs.)  We also feature HD clips from our 
acclaimed Global Health series, “Rx for Survival” shot all over the world, as well 
as climate change and more. Search and browse the collection and download
